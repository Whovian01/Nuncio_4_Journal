The most difficult level from Human Resource Machine was level 11. In this level, you had to subtract the numbers in a certain 
way in order to pass the level. The difficult part about this was trying to understand what it was asking and how to do it
with the code. I finally figured it out by tinkering and asking others who already finished for tips.
	
I first went to the inbox and then copied it to box 0. Then, I grabbed the next number from the inbox and placed
it in box 1. After that, the code takes the second number and subtracts the first from it, then places the result in the outbox.
Afterwards, it goes and copies the first number and then subtracts the second from it, then places that in the outbox. The program then
jumps to the beginning of the code over and over until all of the numbers are gone from the inbox.
