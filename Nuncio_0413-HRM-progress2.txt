The biggest challenge I solved in HRM was year 20, where you had to multiply the numbers. Trying to get the two numbers to 
multiply when their was no command to do it automatically was a bit hard to figure out.
	
In year 20, to multiply the numbers I had to add the same number multiple times until it resembled the two numbers multiplied.
I did this by first grabbing a number from the inbox, and copying them to box 0 and box 1. After that I grab the next number, and
then copy that to box 5, and if the second number is zero, then I make it so I take the number to the outbox. Then, I subtract
from the second number, and add the number from box 1 with box 2, and copy the sum back to box 1. I continue this until the number
in box 5 becomes zero, and then copy the number from box 1 and put it in the outbox. Then I make the code jump back and start it
over and over again.
