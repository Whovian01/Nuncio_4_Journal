Assembly is a low-level symbolic code converted by an assembler. 

Assembly is good for learning exactly how the code works, because
you will be coding EXACTLY what you need. It is also for direct
hardware manipulation.

Assembly is a low-level language, while Java is a high-level 
language.

Low level languages are deep into the computer and tied very closely to
the machine details. High level languages are focused on letting the 
coder concentrate on the logic of the problem to be solved rather than 
having them focus on the intricaties of the machine's architecture.

Java is a high level language. Java is all about fixing the problem, 
rather actually coding into the hardware.
