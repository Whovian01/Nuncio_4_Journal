This code sets up the spritesheet for the player class and also all of the 
frames for the character's movement.

It would be unrealistic to memorize Slick syntax because we are trying to learn 
to solve problems through the basic knowledge we have, and not through
memorization.
	
An array is a list of things; it can be ints or Strings.
	
To make an array, you would write either int[] or String[], and the name of 
the array. Then, you would write = new int[]String[];. However, you could just 
fill in what the array is, such as = {"Hello", "World", "!"};.
	
An ArrayList is like an array, but an ArrayList can have more things added to 
the list instead of having a static amount of things in it.
	
To make an ArrayList, you would write ArrayList<int/String> obj = new 
ArrayList<int/String>();
	
The ArrayList can have more things added to the list instead of having a 
static amount of things in the list, like an array.
	
To make a health counter for an avatar, we could have an array or an ArrayList 
that has numbers 1-100, and then we could count that number down everytime the 
player loses health.
