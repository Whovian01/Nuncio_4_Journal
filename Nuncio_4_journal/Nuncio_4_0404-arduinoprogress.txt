I have made codes for my LEDs that makes them blink one after the other in a cool pattern.

I need to start putting my lights in the DATA man. I can do that after I get help drilling holes in it.
 
Well I hope that i will be able to finally put the lights on the DATA man by Friday.

Mostly what I have been changing is the delay of the lights to change the speed in which they blink.

Since my code is simple, I have not made any new functions because I have taken ideas from the code examples online.
