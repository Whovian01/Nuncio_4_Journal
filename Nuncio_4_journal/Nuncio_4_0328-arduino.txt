One similarity I noticed was the fact that Arduino uses functions, which, like Java or other C programming languages, allows the code to run sort of like a method. I also saw that they share some of the same datatypes, such as ints. Another similarity was the fact that the code would pass values, much like Java can. One difference was that I could not see any classes or objects, meaning that Arduino is not an object oriented program.

I have not made any code adaptions; However, i will be changing something rather simple For example, changing the delay for the LED to 2000 milaseconds rather than 1000 I will probably also add sound at one point. 
	
First, a circuit must have power, or no part of it would work. A circuit must also have a starting and ending point, and within this, there can be any number of components included, which will make use of the power and perform a function.


The first one my partner and I did was circuit 1, the blinking LED. This circuit would make an LED of any color, blink. 
This circuit taught me about the functions "setup()" and "loop()", as well as the "pinMode()" function, which configures the pins and their outputs. 
 I also learned about "delay" and how we can delay the code for a certain amount of time.

For my project, I am going to use multiple LEDs to light up the DATA man that we have (wherever he may be). Believe it or not, but it took me a while to figure out just how to add another LED in the code. However, now i think i am getting a full understanding of what to do. I will make the lights for my project blink in a cool way to make the DATA man look nice.
        I am yet to find a way to put sound, though.
