The reason for typing elf64 was to know how many bits the program is.

ld is used to load the program

We didn't have to use chmod to make it executable because it has already been
executed at the file level.


global _start

	section .text
_start:
	; write(1, message, 13)
	mov	rax, 1
	mov	rdi, 1
	mov	rsi, message
	mov	rdx, 15

	;exit(0)
	mov	eax, 60
	xor	rdi, rdi
	syscall
message:
	db	"Catrina Nuncio", 10


This is not at all easy or quick because you have to code everything in depth,
not just type using already made libraries. 

Low level means 'down to the real basic code', and not something that
accesses premade libraries where everything is done for you already.
